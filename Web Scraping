# Loop through all of the children of the first div and print out each one.

for child in soup.div.children:

# Find all of the a elements on the page and store them in a list called turtle_links

Given the following seuss.html file, what would we put in the blank to print out "Blue"?

<ul>
<li class="one">Red</li>
<li class="fish">Fish</li>
<li class="two">Blue</li>
<li class="fish">Fish</li>
</ul>

>> select(".two").get_text()
>> This will take the list element with id two, which has ‘Blue’ as the text.
